# Grandpa Riddle
There are 3 pairs of tigers and cubs.
They want to cross a river, with 1 boat.
The boat only fits two.
Only the 3 tigers and 1 of the cubs know how to row the boat.

Let's call one of the tigers bob.
Bob cannot leave his cub alone with any other tiger because they will eat his cub.
That goes for all the tigers.

How do they get across the river such that everyone is safe and sound.

# Solution
Capital letters are tigers, cubs are lower case.
Cub 'a' is the cub that can row the boat.
