# Employing Computer Science to Crack a Rural Chinese Riddle, and Formulate a Better One!

## Outline
* Background on the riddle
  * Grandpa presented it to me when I was a kid
  * I was gripped, and spent 3 straight hours working on it
  * Eventually, I got the correct solution and felt triumphant!
  * By that time, I already showed an affinity for mathematical puzzles, so beating my older cousin to the solution was ego-affirming
  * Of course, with what I know now, I was basically running a brute-force algorithm where all I had to do is to persevere through many tries and keep a vague memory of the various steps of the puzzle I already met before

* My goal in doing this is to connect with my 88 year old grandpa after 6 years of not seeing each other (due to life and covid)
  * My chinese is poor, and cannot communicate what's going on in my life very well
  * He's eyesight was also poor, so I could not show him my life as a engineering student, nor was he caught up with the technology of the modern day
  * However, I can demonstrate it by using my newly learnt computer science skills to crack our favorite riddle

* To further demonstrate my power, I want show the generality of my solution by finding a variant of the riddle
  * In order to find a good variant, I first must answer the question of what makes the riddle fun
  * I discovered to fundamental barrier blocking many people from persevering to the solution
  * I decided the riddle was slightly too difficult, and seeked to find an easier version which many more can solve and enjoy the tinggliness after having found the answer
